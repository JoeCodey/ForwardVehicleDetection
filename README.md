Code is distributed across multiple branches.




Master branch and branch Still_images, currently contain a version of the project that only works on the sample "still images provided". The code has been re-organized and optimized. 



VideoImplementation Branch and Video_EdgeBoxOnly contain code which reads from a video sequence and computes the score using only EdgeBoxing. 



Horizontal_Adventure Branch contains the FINAL code with all optimizations. This code reads from a video sequence and computes a detection score using Edge Boxing complemented with Horizontal Line detection.
