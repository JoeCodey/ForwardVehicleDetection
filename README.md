# Forward Vehicle Detection

The goal of this project was aimed to develop a camera-based detection technique for forward vehicle detection.

## Design Constraints and Goals
- Develop sufficient candidates for a vehicle that is in the lane immediately in front of a vehicle
- Generate these candidates using only computer vision techniques on a camera feed. (i.e exploring a use case without a radar / lidar techniques. 
- Compute the distance of the approaching car 
- Understand causes for high-risk collision events
